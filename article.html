                    <p>Photos are one of the best ways we capture memories, tell stories, and share life’s joy. Whether you’re a new mom looking to ways to capture the best photos possible of your baby growing up, looking for <a href="https://www.shutterfly.com/ideas/instagram-photo/" target="_blank">creative Instagram photo ideas</a>, or you’re planning a trip to a picturesque location with plenty of photo opportunities – there’s many different reasons to pick up photography. But if you’re new to DSLRs or not quite used to your smartphone camera, your camera may feel a little intimidating. If so, we have you covered with our guide on photography for beginners. We’ll help you figure out the camera and photography basics along with providing some of our favorite photography tips for beginners.</p>

                    <blockquote><em>“Photography is a way of feeling, of touching, of loving. What you have caught on film is captured forever… It remembers little things, long after you have forgotten everything.”</em> <span>Aaron Siskind</span></blockquote>

                    <h2>Camera Basics</h2>
                    <p>Before you dive into taking photos, you need to understand how your equipment works. Learning about the features and mechanics of your camera – whether that’s a point-and-shoot, smartphone, or DSLR – is vital.</p>

                    <h3>Camera Features For Beginners</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Viewfinder (and grid mode):</strong> You can use the viewfinder to help strategize the composition of your photo. Grid mode turns on a helpful planning grid within the screen.</li>
                        <li><strong>Zoom:</strong> While it’s generally recommended to stay away from zooming, as this reduces quality in pictures, it’s important to understand the limitations and benefits of your camera’s zoom.</li>
                        <li><strong>Focus:</strong> Most cameras come with auto focus, but you should also figure out how to change this setting to manual once you get comfortable with other photography basics. This will help you take more visually interesting photos.
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Shutter Speed:</strong> Too fast a shutter speed and your images come out dark, too slow and they’ll come out blurry. Try to find a balance.</li>
                        <li><strong>Flash:</strong> While most photographers try to stick to external light sources, you still need to understand the basics behind your camera’s flash.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Photography Basics</h2>
                    <p>Once you’ve taken the time to get to know your equipment, it’s time to start practicing. Begin by seeking out examples of photographers you admire and planning out the type of photography you want to do. Save your favorite example photos for reference and plan out locations for your photoshoots. Then, once you’re ready, refer to the steps below.</p>

                            Hello,I guess I’m a camera junkie LOL
                            I have most of the listed cameras plus others.
                            Don’t forget linhoff, Rolleiflex TLR, sinar, mamiya 645 1000s… Fuji GX680 with tilt, shift and swing… still a masterpiece.</p>

                            I still think Nikon reflex mirror is superior-real view-… just give me a modular design where I can just “slip in a new shutter, sensor, memory interface and I will grab it… think Insta360 </p>
